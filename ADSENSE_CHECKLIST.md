## 💰 After Approval

### Adding Ads to Your Site

Once approved, you'll get your Publisher ID: `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

**I can help you:**

**Best ad placements for your site:**

## 📊 Expected Revenue (Estimates)

**Conservative (first 3 months):**
- **1,000 visitors/month** → 100-400 Kč/month
- Just your classmates finding it

**Optimistic (after 6 months):**
- **10,000 visitors/month** → 1,500-6,000 Kč/month  
- Word spreads to other schools

**Best case (viral):**
- **50,000+ visitors/month** → 10,000-30,000 Kč/month

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Content Issues to Fix (Optional but Recommended):

**File: `/ict/hw/09-tiskarny-plotry.html` line 164:**
```html
<!-- Currently has Ukrainian/Russian text: -->
<li><strong>Použití:</strong>Ювелирні модели, стоматологія, прототипи</li>

<!-- Should be: -->
<li><strong>Použití:</strong> Šperky, zubní lékařství, prototypy</li>
```

This won't block AdSense approval but good to fix for consistency.
